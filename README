For my implementation I used Java with Spring Boot framework, which is very popular and naturally is to chose that him for implementation this little REST api.
Also, I used H2 database and Hibernate framework which  mapped my entites into database tables and made dependency between tables. 

You can build project with command:
mvn clean comile -U
Run application with command:
mvn spring-boot:run

When app is successfully started you can run curl commands:
1. post one beer:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
